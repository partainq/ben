# project: ben

## Introduction

Hi! This is **Ben**!
The hope for project: ben is to create a way for people to have one place to ask multiple Taylor University related questions. We wanted to combine multiple knowledge bases in an effective, fun, and comfortable way. In addition, we wanted to add other interesting functions like setting up study tables anonymously, setting up CSE events, trivia, and games.
